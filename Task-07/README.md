# SPECKit Plus

## What Is SPECKit Plus?

SPECKit Plus is an AI-powered, spec-driven development toolkit that helps developers build software through clear specifications instead of random prompting. You write a structured “spec,” and the AI turns it into clean, consistent, production-quality code. It removes guesswork, reduces errors, and lets developers act more like architects, not typists.

## Installation

```bash
npm install specifyplus
```

## Core Concepts

### 1. /constitution — Project Rules & Pillars
The `/constitution` defines the permanent rules, principles, quality standards, and boundaries of your entire project. It works like the “law” of the system, keeping every feature aligned, stable, and predictable.

### 2. /specify — Writing the Feature Specification
Here you describe exactly what you want to build. You explain the feature, inputs/outputs, behaviors, and success criteria. This becomes the AI’s blueprint, so it knows exactly what to code.

### 3. /plan — Turning Specs Into a Roadmap
Once the specs are ready, SPECKit Plus generates a full Plan.md containing:
- Milestones
- Architecture decisions
- Tasks
- Dependencies
- Implementation order
It’s basically your step-by-step project game plan.

### 4. /tasks — Breaking Work into Small Chunks
This phase splits the plan into tiny, clear, executable tasks. Each task is easy for the AI to complete one-by-one without confusion. Perfect for tracking progress and avoiding chaos.

### 5. /implement — AI Builds the Project
Now the AI starts coding the tasks in order. You review after each task and approve or request changes. The AI keeps building until the feature or project is fully complete.
