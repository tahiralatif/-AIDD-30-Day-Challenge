# 🚀 30-Day AI-Driven Development Challenge

Welcome! This repository documents my 30-day journey exploring modern ways to build smarter software.  

In this challenge, I’ll dive into:  
- 🤖 **AI-Driven Development**  
- 🧠 **AI-Native Development**  
- 📜 **Spec-Driven Development**  

Each day, I’ll complete one activity, document my learnings, notes, and progress here.  

**Goal:** Understand how these approaches make software development more efficient, scalable, and innovative.

## 📚 Learning From

This challenge is inspired by the **Spec‑Driven Development methodology** from the AI‑Native Panaversity Handbook:  
[https://ai-native.panaversity.org/docs/Spec-Driven-Development](https://ai-native.panaversity.org/docs/Spec-Driven-Development)

Key lessons I’m applying:  
- Build features from **structured specifications** first, not vague ideas.  
- Specs act as a **contract** between me and AI agents, defining inputs, outputs, constraints, and tests.  
- Use **Memory Banks / Constitutions** for shared rules across all features.  
- Capture decisions and AI collaboration using **ADRs** (Architectural Decision Records) and **PHRs** (Prompt History Records).  
- Implement a **“spec-as-source” mindset**, letting specs guide both code generation and future changes.  

Let’s learn, experiment, and build something awesome together! ✨
